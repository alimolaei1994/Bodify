# Genetics Fitness Social App UI

This is a code bundle for Genetics Fitness Social App UI. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/XFoTuOLkXGnOqBhff9VAnY/Genetics-Fitness-Social-App-UI.

## Running the code

1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server (http://localhost:3000 by default).

## Deployment

- **Vercel**: `vercel.json` now targets the built-in Next.js runtime (`npm run build` + `.next` output).
- **Netlify**: `netlify.toml` runs the same build and loads `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` so SSR features work out of the box.
