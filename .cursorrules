# Cursor Rules for RiseStyle Project

## Git Workflow

Whenever you make changes to the project, you must follow these steps:

### 0. Build & Lint (Before Commit)
- **Always** build before committing and fix any errors:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- If there are build errors, **must** fix them before committing
- Also check and fix lint errors:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
- **Never** commit with build or lint errors

### 1. Commit Changes
- Always add all changed files before committing
- Use meaningful commit messages that clearly describe the changes
- Format: `type: description` (e.g., `feat: Add RiseStyle logo`)

### 2. Update Version
- After each commit, update the version in `package.json`
- Use Semantic Versioning:
  - **MAJOR** (x.0.0): Breaking changes
  - **MINOR** (0.x.0): New features
  - **PATCH** (0.0.x): Bug fixes and small changes

### 3. Update CHANGELOG.md
- Always update CHANGELOG.md after committing
- Add changes to the `[Unreleased]` section or new version
- Use the following format:
  ```markdown
  ## [Version]
  - Description of new changes
  - Description of existing changes
  - Description of bug fixes
  ```

## Project Conventions

- All imports must use `@/` (not relative paths)
- All text content must be in Persian
- Font used: Vazir
- Page direction: RTL
- App name: RiseStyle

## Code Style

- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Components must be in `components/`
- Pages must be in `app/` (Next.js App Router)

## Type Definitions

- **Always** place component types in the `types/` folder and keep them separate
- **For each component, create a separate type file** in `types/`
- Use naming convention `ComponentName.types.ts`
- **Each component must have its own type file** (not a shared file)
- Export types and import them in components:
  ```typescript
  // types/Dashboard.types.ts
  export interface DashboardProps {
    // ...
  }
  
  // types/Sidebar.types.ts
  export interface SidebarProps {
    // ...
  }
  
  // components/Dashboard.tsx
  import type { DashboardProps } from '@/types/Dashboard.types'
  
  // components/Sidebar.tsx
  import type { SidebarProps } from '@/types/Sidebar.types'
  ```
- **Never** write types inline in components, always separate them
- **Never** write types for multiple components in one file, each component should have its own type file

## Important Notes

- **Always** before commit: Build → Fix Errors → Commit → Update Version → Update CHANGELOG
- Never commit with build or lint errors
- Never leave changes without committing
- Before pushing, make sure everything is committed
